                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>His career as an author began with a pair of techno-thriller novels. The first novel, Daemon, was self-published under his own company, Verdugo Press, in late 2006. It was later picked up by the major publishing house Dutton and re-released on January 8, 2009. His follow-up book Freedomâ„¢ was released on January 7, 2010. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Walter F. Parkes, who produced the 1983 film WarGames, had optioned the film rights to Daemon with Paramount Pictures in 2009, but the rights likely reverted to Suarez on 8 December 2012.</p>
                    <p>Suarez announced in November 2011 that he was writing his third novel, "which deals with autonomous drones and next-gen, anonymous warfare" (via his Google Plus Account).[full citation needed] That novel, Kill Decision, was released on July 19, 2012. His next book, Influx, was released on February 20, 2014. Influx won the 2015 Prometheus Award. His fifth book, Change Agent, was released on April 18, 2017 and uses CRISPR as its theme. His most recent novel, Delta-v (2019), deals with the near future effects of asteroid mining and the privatization of space, and is the first part of a trilogy.</p>
